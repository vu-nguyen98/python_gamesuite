# The Python Game Suite Project
<br>

#### What is this all about?
The Python Game Suite is a project that I developed to help me learn Python as well as develop something cool that can demonstrate what I learned in Python.<br>
This readme will constantly be updated to reflect the status of the project.

#### What's in the suite?
These are the games that I plan on making:
<ol>
<li>Hangman: The game is already 90% done. What's left is to implement a way to continuously play games or exit back to main menu, and also a way to keep track of scores and win-rate.</li>
<li>Lights Out: The classic light-flipping game. I plan on including different grid options to make the game more replayable.</li>
<li>Tic-Tac-Toe: I plan on using object-oriented concepts to create the game. I also plan on making a semi-smart bot that should be able to always pick the most optimized options.</li>
<li>Shirotori: The twist on the classic Japanese word game. I plan on using a scorekeeping system to encourage players to pick the longest words to gain more points.</li>
</ol>

#### Usage of the suite
**Note:** These instructions are geared towards Windows users!

Please use this Git line on your PowerShell, Git Bash or CMD to install the entire repository on your computer (pick an empty folder!)
```buildoutcfg
git clone https://github.com/vu-nguyen98/python_gamesuite.git
```
Then, in your powershell or CMD window (you can get there by right-clicking within the python_gamesuite folder and click **Open PowerShell window here**), type in
```python
python main.py
```
The game will then run in your PowerShell window, enjoy!

**Note:** If your PowerShell cannot run `python main.py`, you will need to install Python first. just type in the PowerShell window `python` and it should redirect you to Microsoft Store to install Python.

### Thank you for reading, and please enjoy the game!
